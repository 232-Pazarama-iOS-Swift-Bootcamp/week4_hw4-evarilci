## Flickr App

    I build a semi working flickr client app using flickr API. It fetches recent photos from flickr and shows them on custom tableview. I use firebaseAuth to authnticate user. Once you sign in the app remembers until you sign out. You can like photos by tapping heart button under the image. When you like a photo it will be stored in firebase firestore for you.

## What I could do:

- Using MOYA library to communicate to Flickr API
- Firebase Auth and Firestore works effectively
- Used SnapKit to create all components. It looks sweet!
- Followed MVVM architecture most parts.
- Used SPM for third party libraries.
- Minimum Deployment version is iOS 12

## What I couldn't do

- Eventhough saving data on firestore occurs successfully, could not manage to make it show on screen.
- implementing search API and search bar
- Used some closures but Delegates what?
